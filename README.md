# Slot Machine (WIP)

A small browser-based slot machine game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This is a personal learning project I created to explore JS game logic, animations, and modular code structure.

## Work in Progress

This project is **not finished yet**.  
The core mechanics are implemented,  
but several planned features - such as bonus game, sounds, visual polish and data storage - are still under development.  

I’m keeping it public to document my progress and show my growth as a developer.

## Features
- Randomized reels with 6 columns and multiple symbols  
- Betting system with adjustable bet amount and balance tracking  
- Win detection with multiplier logic  
- Autoplay mode with configurable spin count  
- Colorful explosion effects for winning symbols  
- Clean modular code: DOM handling, logic, effects, and state separated  

---

## Technologies
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for visuals
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)** for game logic  
- No frameworks or libraries - fully written from scratch
